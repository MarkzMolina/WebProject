            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>Information technology, or IT,  describes any technology that powers or enables the storage, processing and information flow within an organization, anything involved with computers, software, networks, intranets, Web sites, servers, databases and telecommunications. A large corporation with an active website, such as Comcast, Verizon or Cisco, has a full-time staff of Web personnel to keep the site content updated and have live chats with site visitors. This support staff may work directly for the owner of the website or for a contractor who provides IT staff. For many small businesses, this level of support is being replaced by cloud-based help desk software, and the IT industry will continue shrinking as more of these jobs can be done by computers.</p>
